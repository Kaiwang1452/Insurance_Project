# Insurance Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **Insurance Data Analysis and Prediction**, leveraging data-driven techniques to extract insights and build predictive models. The goal is to analyze key insurance trends, detect fraud, and improve risk assessment using machine learning.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on insurance datasets.
- Identify **key risk factors** affecting insurance claims.
- Develop predictive models for **claim approvals, fraud detection, or pricing optimization**.
- Visualize results using **data dashboards and reports**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** for data manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis
- **Power BI / Tableau** for data visualization
- **Machine Learning models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes policyholder details, claim history, premium amounts, and fraud indicators. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
